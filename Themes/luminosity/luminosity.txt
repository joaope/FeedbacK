luminosity 1.3 by zioxide
-------------------------
luminosity is a theme created for MTS 1.1 by zioxide.  I created it after seeing some nice themes on screenshots on various mirc websites, and I even got the colors for the beach theme from a screenshot of JOKRKNEX.
luminosity consists of the default scheme, 'midnight', and four schemes: 'beach', 'lunar', 'ice', and '2Graphik'.  A new version with more schemes will be available soon.  To use, just extract to your themes directory, run your mts engine, and select the theme.  Enjoy!
